# Student Performance Prediction

This is a practice project that was created with the help of a follow along Tutorial by [Krish Naik](https://github.com/krishnaik06/mlproject.git). 

## Introduction

1. In this project we used modular code for data ingestion, data transformation and model training
2. After training our model this way we prepared a prediction pipeline
3. This was followed by a basic flask app and some HTML, CSS front-end
4. This project was later deployed on Azure using github actions

## Project Layout

Following are the GIFs that showcase how the project worked in real time, the app was deleted since keeping it on Azure for long time would've meant additional charges.



## Installing the project

1. Check the 'e- .' requirements.txt file, un-comment it if commented.
2. write the following command in terminal 
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. comment 'e- .' again

Now you should be able to run the project in your systems.
